## Welcome

I'm a nerd. Straight up. I love learning things that stretch my brain to process the world and its wonders in new ways. The problem (if you could even call it that), is that the more I learn, the less I feel I know. The sad truth is that I know very little, but that doesn't discourage me!

I'm a hacker at heart. Even though I write code for my career, I also find myself coding as my hobby. I love to tinker, I love being on the command line, and I love creating new things for computers to do. I have a passion for using Linux and aesthetic minimalism. For me, software engineering is creating a work of art that solves a practical problem.
